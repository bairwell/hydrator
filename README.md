### Standards Checking
[PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/) highlights potential coding standards issues.

`vendor/bin/phpcs`

PHP CS will use the configuration in `phpcs.xml.dist` by default.

To see which sniffs are running add "-s"

## Unit Tests
[PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de) is installed for unit testing (tests are in `tests`)

To run unit tests:
`vendor/bin/phpunit`

For a list of the tests that have ran:
`vendor/bin/phpunit --tap`

To restrict the tests run:
`vendor/bin/phpunit --filter 'Cors\\Exceptions\\BadOrigin'`

or just

`vendor/bin/phpunit --filter 'ExceptionTest'`

for all tests which have "Exception" in them and:
`vendor/bin/phpunit --filter '(ExceptionTest::testEverything|ExceptionTest::testStub)'`

to test the two testEverything and testStub methods in the ExceptionTest class.
